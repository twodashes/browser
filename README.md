# Browser-specific functions - to help with AJAX, URLs, Promises, Retina, OS, etc.

That one has much more functionality. Any JavaScript functions that can be used in Node as well as the browser are stored in [twodashes-universal](#). This twodashes-browser package has only functions that can NOT be used in Node.js, such as is_retina, http_ajax, http_get, querystring_from_object, etc. These can be used with a `<script>` tag, or `import` by Webpack/Babel.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PLEASE NOTE: ‚ö†Ô∏è

All names in this library (functions, files) will change. Currently figuring out what to call everything. This library will be stabled when released as **`version 1`**. These functions all check for `typeof window === 'object'`, and should quit gracefully if used in server-side rendering, but don't rely on this until version 1. The "http" AJAX functions rely on a global `fetch` variable.

# Installation

These are exported for your choice of environment. When importing, specify **cjs**/**esm**/**\_\_** format. The **\_\_** is meant to be used with the browser `<script>` tag. It creates a `window.__` variable.

```JavaScript
  <!-- download all functions into window.__ -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/twodashes-universal@latest/__/index.js"></script>
  <!-- download only the types of functions you need_ -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/twodashes-universal@latest/__/sort_strings.js"></script>
```

## ES Modules

```JavaScript
  import { sort_by_rating_and_position } from "@twodashes/universal/esm/sort_strings"
```

## CommonJS

```JavaScript
  const sort_strings = require(twodashes-universal/esm/sort_strings")
```

Why not UMD modules standard? **Code splitting**. By specifying your choice "esm" (ES Modules), "cjs" (CommonJS) or "\_\_" (`window.__`), you're able to download only the specific functions you actually need, not everthing else. Additionally on the browser, you can download multiple times using multiple`<script>`tags (for example both`twodashes-universal`and`twodashes-browser`, or`/sort_strings`and`/arrays`). All downloaded scripts will be combined into one single flat`window.__` dictionary/object. See [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/twodashes-universal-demo-2r4os). Please do message ([Paul](https://paulshorey.com)) if this is unclear, or if may know a better way of accomplishing all this.

This project is built using ES Modules in `./esm`. It is then compiled into CommonJS into `./cjs` and for the browser (exported as window.**) in `./**`. Read more about [ES Modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html).

## npm run build:

**npm run build** runs these npm scripts, in this order:

1. **ignore_index** - Copy ./esm/index.js to ./index.mjs (so it does not get converted in next step \*\*)
2. **esm_cjs** - Convert ./esm to ./cjs
3. **putback_index** - Copy ./index.mjs back to ./esm/index.js
4. **esm_cjs_index** - Convert ./esm/index.js to ./cjs/index.js (so it can get processed without reference to other files)
5. **browser** - Convert ./esm to ./\_\_

\*\* Don't want to convert `./esm/index.js` to `./cjs/index.js` along with all the other modules in `./esm`, because `rollup` breaks up the functions to prevent redundant code. But I actually want `index.js` to be redundant, to contain code that is already in the other module files. This way, `index.js` is self-contained, and other files are self-contained, not importing anything. I could not figure out how to configure `rollup` command to NOT build with `require()` commands. Can not have `require()` commands because the `parcel` command does convert to browser code well with require commands. Each file already needs to be self-contained before running `parcel build`.
